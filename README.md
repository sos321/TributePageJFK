# Tribute page for John F. Kennedy

This webpage is a tribute page for JFK. It lists a few of his most important achievements and struggles.

This is a very simple site created for the freecodecamp.org curriculum.

## Technologies

Beacause of the sites simplicity I used only the most basic tools.

-   HTML
-   CSS

## What I learned

This project was more a refresher and practice for basic HTML and CSS coding. I learned a new way how to animate links. It was created in about 2 hours.
